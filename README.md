The Gaming Room

1.  Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.  Who was the client?  What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only.  They want to design an application that will render images form a large library of stock drawings as clues.  The game will consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit.  The client requests to provide a game with the ability to have one or more teams involved; each team will have multiple players assigned to it; game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name; and only one instance of the game can exist in memory at and given time by creating unique identifies for each instance of a game, team, or player.  

2.  What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In developing this documentation, I believe I did particularly well with UML diagram.  It visually represented what the client’s application would look like.  It was well organized and explicitly identified the parameters of the different components of the application

3.  What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through a design document made it helpful for me to plan how to develop the code.  When creating a project it can be overwhelming in the beginning about where to begin or how to get started.  The design document provided structure and a path of what information should be included

4.  If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick?  How would you improve it?

The part of the document I would choose to revise would be the Recommendation’s section.  The feedback from the instructor I received was to provide recommendations for the operating platform Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android or iOS.  I provided a general recommendations around cloud-based platforms or traditional operating platforms.  Instead I would specifically discuss how to application could be used on the Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android or iOS operating platforms.  

5.  How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design?  Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To interpret the user’s needs and implement them into the software design, it was important to gather the user’s requirements, analyze the user’s requirements, design the user’s interface, and test and refine.  Considering the user's needs when designing software is it important because it directly affects the user's experience.  If the software is not designed with the user's needs in mind, it can be challenging to use, frustrating, and may not meet the user's requirements.  By understanding the user's needs and designing the software accordingly, we were able to create a product that was user-friendly, intuitive, and provided an optimal experience for the user.

6.  How did you approach designing software?  What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

To approach designing the software, we identified the problem the client was seeking to resolve and the requirements they had.  Afterwards, we developed a plan by creating a UML diagram to visually represent what the application would look like.  Once this was complete, code was then written, refactored, and tested.  In the future, I would still use this approach or something similar.  Having a software design document to identify the client’s needs and to outline the direction in which to develop the project is helpful and makes it easier for collaboration or expansion if necessary.
